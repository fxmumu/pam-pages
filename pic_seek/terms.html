  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <div class="meta">Effective date: 2025-11-20</div>

  <p>Welcome to PicSeek (the “App”). By using the App or continuing to use its services you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Scope and Acceptance</h2>
  <p>These Terms apply to all users (“you”) of the App and its features. We may update these Terms from time to time; if there are material changes, we will notify you in a reasonable manner. Continued use of the App after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these Terms or the Privacy Policy, or if you wish to exercise rights such as data access, deletion, or correction, please email: <a href="mailto:foxdmu@gmail.com">foxdmu@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>3. Accounts and Permissions</h2>
  <p>If a feature requires login or authorization (for example, access to your photo library), you must provide accurate, lawful information and safeguard your credentials. When authorizing access to local photos or other device content, ensure that you have the legal right to use that content.</p>

  <h2>4. Feature Overview (Non-technical)</h2>
  <p>The App provides photo management, search, grouping, similar-image finding, sharing, and device album synchronization features. Availability of features may vary depending on OS permissions, device capabilities, or subscription status. Descriptions of features in these Terms are for overview purposes only and do not include implementation details or internal processing mechanisms.</p>

  <h2>5. Storage and Uploading of User Data (Important)</h2>
  <p>Except for payment and subscription receipts related to the App Store/purchase system, users’ personal data within the App (for example, albums, photos, tags, indexes, or derived data from analysis) are by default stored locally on the user’s device and are not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly enable optional features that require upload/synchronization (for example, optional cloud backup or cross-device sync).</p>
  <p>We use Firebase Analytics to collect basic app interaction events (for example, screen views and button taps) to improve the App. This data does not include photo content. For more privacy details, please refer to our <a href="../privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>In-app purchases are processed through Apple’s App Store. Purchases, renewals, and refunds are governed by Apple’s policies. We may record user entitlements (for example, whether a user has the Pro version) locally or on optional servers based on valid receipts we receive. If you have issues purchasing or restoring subscriptions, please consult Apple support first or contact us.</p>

  <h2>7. Content and Usage Rules</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use the App to engage in illegal, infringing, or rights-violating activities. Do not upload or process content you do not have the right to use. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access and remove content for violations of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is”; we do not provide express warranties regarding uninterrupted service, fitness for a particular purpose, or specific outcomes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for indirect, special, or punitive damages arising from or related to use of or inability to use the App. Where the law requires liability to be imposed, the liability cap will be the amount actually paid by the user to us for use of the App during a specified period (if no payment was made, the law’s minimum allowed amount will apply).</p>

  <h2>9. Suspension and Termination</h2>
  <p>If a user is found to be in violation of these Terms or applicable law, we may suspend or terminate their access to some or all features and take necessary measures (including deleting related content).</p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the developer’s location. Parties should first try to resolve disputes by friendly consultation; if consultation fails, disputes may be brought before a court with jurisdiction or resolved by arbitration under applicable law.</p>

  <h2>11. Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, it does not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. These Terms together with the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding use of the App.</p>

  <h2>12. App Display Names (consistent with the Privacy Policy)</h2>
