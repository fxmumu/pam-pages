  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025-12-22</p>

  <h2>Acceptance</h2>
  <p>By downloading or using TagCamera ("the App"), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>License</h2>
  <p>We grant you a personal, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to use the App on devices you own or control, subject to these Terms and App Store rules.</p>

  <h2>User Content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain all rights to photos and tags you create.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for ensuring you have rights to any content you capture or import.</li>
    <li>We do not claim ownership of your content and do not upload it to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local Storage and Backups</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App may store photos inside the App's local sandbox storage (on your device). Depending on your settings, some photos may not be automatically saved to the iOS Photos library.</li>
    <li>If a photo is important, you should enable <strong>Settings → Save to Photos</strong> in the App to ensure it is also saved to your iOS Photos library.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for managing your own backups. If you delete the App, clear its data, reset your device, or otherwise remove the App's local storage without first saving important photos to the iOS Photos library, those photos may be permanently lost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prohibited Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No unlawful, infringing, harmful, or abusive use.</li>
    <li>No reverse engineering, decompiling, or circumventing security features.</li>
    <li>No use that could damage, disable, or interfere with the App or others' devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review it to understand how we handle data.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for data loss resulting from your device settings or actions, including but not limited to disabling <strong>Settings → Save to Photos</strong>, uninstalling the App, clearing App data, device resets, or other actions that remove the App’s local sandbox storage.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or loss of data arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time; uninstalling removes local app data (except items you saved to the iOS Photos library). Before uninstalling, please ensure important photos have been saved to the iOS Photos library.</p>

  <h2>Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your country or region of residence unless local law requires otherwise.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised Terms.</p>
